# Image-Thresholding-Algorithms-with-OpenCV
This repository explores various image thresholding techniques using OpenCV in Python. Image thresholding is a fundamental concept in image processing and computer vision, used for image segmentation. 
The repository covers the following topics:

Simple Thresholding: A basic technique that converts a grayscale image to a binary image by comparing pixel intensities with a predefined threshold value.
Otsu's Thresholding: An optimal thresholding method that automatically calculates the threshold value by minimizing intra-class variance.
Adaptive Thresholding: A technique that calculates the threshold for a small region of the image, allowing for different thresholds in different regions.
Implementation with OpenCV: Practical examples demonstrating each technique's implementation using the OpenCV library.
Bonus: U-Net for Image Segmentation: A brief overview of the U-Net architecture, a deep learning model commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different thresholding techniques in your image processing projects!
